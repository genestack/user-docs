* Clicking the **Export** button will open a new window where all the files associated with the study will be compressed.
* Once the files are compressed, the download button will be active and the files can be downloaded to your local computer.
* The link is pre-authenticated so anyone with the link will be able to download the study and associated data.
* Previous export links that have been generated will be listed at the bottom of the screen. These are archive versions and will reflect the data at the time the link was generated, not necessarily the latest version.
