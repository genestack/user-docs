<hr/>

## 1.28 (8 Sep 2020)

### New/updated features in this release

- New user interface for groups administration

- The curation helper script doesn't work for Variant, Expression and Flow Cytometry objects, only for studies and samples

### New RESTful API endpoints for asynchronous linking

For creating links between objects:

```text
POST​ /links
```

For finding links between objects:

```text
GET /links
POST /links/get-batch
```

For deleting existing links:

```text
DELETE /links
```

There are two additional endpoints that can be queried for information on data-types and possible links between them:

```text
GET /data-types
GET /data-types/links
```

<hr/>

## 1.27.1 (11 Aug 2020)

### Fixed issues

The status code returned when calling various endpoints that retrieve or delete a non-existing file will now return `404` rather than `400`. Various other small fixes have been made to the swagger documentation as well.

<hr/>

## 1.27 (7 Aug 2020)

### New features in this release

- **GENE-TRANSCRIPT MAPPING**: ODM can now work with gene-transcript mapping files. Users are able to load a mapping file, link it to expression matrices and search for genes and transcripts in mapping files to retrieve correspondingly mapped transcripts/genes.

### Fixed issues

- The curation helper script has several improvements:
    - When a value is mapped to a new attribute name a copy is no longer kept under the old attribute name.
    - Non-template attributes that have no values remaining after a mapping are removed.
    - Multi-value mappings now work correctly.
    - Whitespace values are no longer substituted, preventing a possible data corruption issue.

### Known issues

- The curation helper script doesn't work for Variant, Expression and Flow Cytometry objects, only for studies and samples

<hr/>

## 1.26.1 (15 Jul 2020)

### Fixed issues

We fixed a bug in external dictionary synchronisation where new dictionaries were appended to existing ones in the system. Now the new dictionaries (containing changes compared to previous versions) update the existing ones. For dictionaries which have seen no changes, they are skipped by external dictionary service sync.

<hr/>

## 1.26 (7 Jul 2020)

### New features in this release

- **FURTHER CURATION SCRIPT IMPROVEMENTS**: The curation script now handles measurements which contain units properly and includes various bug fixes for edge cases. The script has also been generalised to remove customer-specific jargon or settings.
- **PREVIEW OF LONG VALUES IN THE SAMPLE TABLE**: In some studies which have long values in the sample metadata table, the values were previously truncated and for read-only users, there was no mechanism for the user to see the full value on the user interface. Now a user can simply double-click at a cell of the sample table and a preview box will appear to reveal the full value.

### Known issues

- It is not possible to curate studies loaded by the Superloader from GEO.
- The curation script substitutes sample metadata values which are comprised of whitespaces only (i.e. resembling blank values) with terms from the dictionary in the `rule.json` file. This can potentially corrupt data because the substitution is not easily detected to be rectified.
- Regular (non-curator) users do not have rights to edit templates or change template assignment for a study, even if they have the "Manage template" permission box checked in the "Users and organization" application because being a curator is a pre-requisite of such rights.

<hr/>

## 1.25 (25 Jun 2020)

### New features in this release

- **NEW RELEASE NOTES LINK**: We have added links to public release notes in the dashboard footer and left-hand-side dock menu, so users can refer to the notes for new features, fixed bugs and known bugs/limitations.
- **CURATION SCRIPT IMPROVEMENTS**: The python curation script has been updated to support use cases for curating multi-value fields in sample metadata (e.g. when one sample was treated by two different drugs in the same time point). We also took the opportunity to remove some hardcoded curation rules in the code which are no longer valid and rewrote many error or warning messages so they're more user-friendly and include actionable suggestions for fixing errors

### Fixed issues

- We have fixed a few bugs in the "Superloader" tool for loading data from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), so it's now possible to load again microarray studies (both metadata and indexed data, the latter subject to the files deposited at GEO), as well as sequencing studies (metadata only).

### Known issues

- **NEW**: It is not possible to curate studies loaded by superloader from GEO.
- **NEW**: The curation script currently throws an error and does not proceed with curation when it cannot detect the default template that's used implicitly by an API-loaded study ("implicitly" because the data-loading user did not specify the template for the study and the system falls back on to the default template). This does not lead to data corruption.
- **NEW**: The curation script substitutes sample metadata values which are comprised of whitespaces only (i.e. resembling blank values) with terms from the dictionary in the `rule.json` file. This can potentially corrupt data because the substitution is not easily detected to be rectified.
- Regular (non-curator) users do not have rights to edit templates or change template assignment for a study, even if they have the "Manage template" permission box checked in the "Users and organization" application because being a curator is a pre-requisite of such rights.
- Changes in the template-control status of an attribute are applied properly now due to the bug fix in release `1.23`, albeit sometimes with 20-30 seconds' delay, which in the curation workflow is sometimes not too noticeable and definitely not a blocker().
- As the result of using a different hashing algorithm to preserve the order of facets in the URL, Study Browser URLs bookmarked prior to the `1.23` release will no longer be valid.

<hr/>

## 1.24 (8 Jun 2020)

### New features in this release

- **ASYNCHRONOUS DATA LOADING API ENDPOINTS**: A new extract-transform-load (ETL) service has been rolled out which allows for asynchronous import of study, samples and signals files to ODM via new RESTful API endpoints without HTTP time-outs even for large studies with thousands of samples. Using these endpoints, a user submits a data-loading request and receives a (job execution) identifier for the job that is processed in the background. The identifier can be used to query the job's status and retrieve the result when the request processing is completed. Please see the list of new endpoints at the end of these notes for this release, and the Swagger documentation for API usage.
- **"ACCESSIBLE TO ALL" STUDY BROWSER FACET**: Previously, studies shared with all members of an organisation could be found via the "Shared with me" facet in the study browser, which was not intuitive to our users. We have tweaked the logic of the facets so such studies can now be found under the facet called "For all at &lt;organisation name&gt;".
- **ODM VERSION SHOWN ON THE FOOTER**: Previously it was not possible to see the current ODM version number when a user logged on to ODM on the graphical user interface (GUI). This caused inconvenience when a user could not specify the ODM version used when trying to report an error or an observation about the GUI. From this release onward, the version number is shown in the Dashboard footer and left-hand-side shortcut dock.

### New housekeeping/admin features

- **CLICKHOUSE UPGRADE TO VERSION 20.4**: This upgrade fixes a memory leak issue.

### Fixed issues

- We fixed a labelling issue in the Study Browser's facet breadcrumb trail, where the facet "Study status" should have been called "Curation Status".

### Known issues

(No new issues in this release)

- Regular (non-curator) users do not have rights to edit templates or change template assignment for a study, even if they have the "Manage template" permission box checked in the "Users and organization" application because being a curator is a pre-requisite of such rights.
- The Metadata Editor page shows "infinite" loading if the Bulk Replace operation is triggered on a new attribute that is introduced after applying a new template to the study (can be fixed by page refresh).
- Changes in the template-controlled status of an attribute are applied due to the bug fix (see Fixed Issue number 2 in the section above), albeit sometimes with 20-30 seconds' delay, which in the curation workflow is sometimes not too noticeable and definitely not a blocker.
- API user endpoints currently get staging (draft) version of data from any SPoT/HDAP using the API, instead of the last committed version, while searching by metadata. However, users will get the last committed version if retrieving SPoT/HDAP objects directly via the ID.
- Cursor pagination in the API works incorrectly for expression data.

**New RESTful API endpoints for loading and linking study, samples and expression/variant/flow cytometry signals:**

For loading study, samples and signals:

```text
POST​ /import​/study
POST ​/import​/samples
POST ​/import​/variant
POST ​/import​/expression
POST ​/import​/flow-cytometry
```

For linking signal groups to sample groups:

```text
POST or DELETE ​/integration​/link​/expression​/group​/{sourceId}​/to​/sample​/group​/{targetId}
POST or DELETE ​/integration​/link​/flow-cytometry​/group​/{sourceId}​/to​/sample​/group​/{targetId}
POST or DELETE /integration/link/variant/group/{sourceId}/to/sample/group/{targetId}
```

For initiating, monitoring or stopping an asynchronous job:

```text
GET ​/{jobExecId}​/info
GET ​/{jobExecId}​/output
PUT ​/{jobExecId}​/restart
PUT ​/{jobExecId}​/stop
```

## 1.23 (27 May 2020)

### New features in this release

- **MORE GRANULARITY IN TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT**: Previously, users belonging to the "curators" group all have the rights to manage templates in an organisation. By "manage", we mean editing an existing template, duplicating an existing one, and also assigning a different template as the organisation's default. From this release onward, we delineate the roles of curators and template managers with more granularity. Curators will not be template managers, unless they have been granted the permission to by their organisation's administrator.
- **NEW "USERS AND ORGANIZATION" APPLICATION**: Previously known as "Manage Users", we took the opportunity to update its look-and-feel and improve its functionalities while adding the new "Manage template" permission granularity. Key improvements include clearly indicating the administrators in the organisation and adding a built-in search bar so users can search for a colleague by name or email address. Please also note that from this release onward, an organisational administrator is also prohibited from revoking his/her own admin rights, to ensure at least one other administrator in the organisation is aware of and approves this resignation.
- **STUDY BROWSER'S APPLIED FILTERS DISPLAYED AS INDIVIDUALLY REMOVABLE TAGS**: This is an enhancement of the Study Browser search experience. Facets selected by the user will now appear as tags above the search results, showing a trail of the facet options. Each filter option can be conveniently removed via the tags as if the user has unchecked the facet option. The Study Browser URL contains a hash that remembers the facets and the order they're applied, so a user can share the URL with a colleague to recreate the same set of search criteria. Please note: as the result of using a different hashing algorithm to preserve the order of facets in the URL, Study Browser URLs bookmarked prior to this release will no longer be valid.
- **SWIFTSTACK INTEGRATION**: For customers who use Swiftstack to store data that is later ingested into Genestack, in order for Genestack to access this data, temporary (or pre-signed) URLs can be generated before feeding them into Genestack. For the temporary URLs to be generated, a functionality was implemented for a technical user to access the shared folder on Swiftstack.

### New housekeeping/admin features in this release

- **NEW STATUS FLAG TO TRACK EXPRESSION DATA INDEXING**: As the volume and complexity of expression data grow, we have improved ODM's error-handling when indexing expression data. A status flag is now set in the ODM’s database, with the “failed” status reflecting internal exceptions from the expression data indexer during indexing, while the status “ok” marks the end of indexing (if process is completed without errors). An organisation's administrator or system admin can use this flag to quickly identify expression studies with corrupted indices and re-index them in a targeted way, without having to wipe the whole index and reindex all data from scratch.

### Fixed issues

- We identified a general bug that prevented many graphical user interface applications from reusing resources and caching data properly, resulting in performance penalties. We have fixed this bug and overall the interface is more responsive. The most noticeable improvement is in the Metadata Editor application.
- For a template that is in active use (i.e. applied to a study), if a sample attribute is removed from the template, we expect the attribute to be kept in the study and shown as a non-template-controlled field. This behaviour was broken, but fixed in this release.
- Improved SAML error messages: the system now correctly parses the status of the IdP response and displays more user-friendly error messages.
- For MEX-format single-cell data, `NaN` values in `.mtx` expression matrices used to result in errors which terminate the data indexing process. We have fixed this now so `NaN` or any non-numeric values in .mtx files will be skipped by the system, and the frequency of such skipped entries is recorded in a log file for debugging purposes.

### Known issues

- **NEW**: regular (non-curator) users do not have rights to edit templates or change template assignment for a study, even if they have the "Manage template" permission box checked in the "Users and organization" application because being a curator is a pre-requisite of such rights.
- **NEW**: The Metadata Editor page shows "infinite" loading if the Bulk Replace operation is triggered on a new attribute that is introduced after applying a new template to the study (can be fixed by page refresh).
- **NEW**: Changes in the template-controlled status of an attribute are applied due to the bug fix (see Fixed Issue number 2 in the section above), albeit sometimes with 20-30 seconds' delay, which in the curation workflow is sometimes not too noticeable and definitely not a blocker.
- **NEW**: As the result of using a different hashing algorithm to preserve the order of facets in the URL, Study Browser URLs bookmarked prior to this release will no longer be valid.
- API user endpoints currently get staging (draft) version of data from any SPoT/HDAP using the API, instead of the last committed version, while searching by metadata. However, users will get the last committed version if retrieving SPoT/HDAP objects directly via the ID.
- Cursor pagination in the API works incorrectly for expression data.

## 1.22 (7 May 2020)

### New features in this release

- **NEW NAVIGATION PANEL IN "MANGE GROUPS" APP**: For organisations with many groups or groups with many members, the app's page can get really long and it was cumbersome to scroll precisely to the group of interest. The new navigation panel solves this by allowing users to jump to the group needed.
- **VCF.ZIP SUPPORT**: The vcf indexer used to work with only `vcf.gz` files. From this release onward, we start supporting zip-compressed vcf files too.

### Fixed issues

- In Metadata Editor's bulk replace feature, values in boolean fields can't be replaced or left blank in some cases. This is now fixed.
- In Metadata Editor's bulk replace feature, replacing blank values sometimes failed. In addition, sample counts for blank values inside the bulk replace dialogue were often miscalculated. These bugs related to blank values have been fixed.
- There was an issue with URLs pointing to ODM pages returning an error during opening if they end with a `/` character. The cause of this error was not obvious to the user (even though it was relatively easy to remove the slash). This is now fixed so the ending slash wouldn't hinder links being opened.

### Known issues

- API user endpoints currently get staging (draft) version of data from any SPoT/HDAP using the API, instead of the last committed version, while searching by metadata. However, users will get the last committed version if retrieving SPoT/HDAP objects directly via the ID.
- Cursor pagination in the API works incorrectly for expression data.
